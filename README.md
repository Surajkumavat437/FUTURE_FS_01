##  About the Project
This project is my personal portfolio website developed as part of **Task 1** of the *Future Interns Full Stack Web Development Internship*.

The main goal of this project is to create a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and profile.  
The focus is mainly on **frontend development**.

During development, I also used **AI tools as a learning and productivity aid**—for guidance, explanations, and code structuring—while ensuring I understood and customized the final implementation myself.
